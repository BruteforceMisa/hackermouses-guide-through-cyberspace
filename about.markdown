Welcome to my website! I'm an enthousiastic Artificial Intelligence & Cyber Security student. On this website, I try to explain concepts within this field in a comprehensive and intuitive way using daily examples. I also like to add my personal tech projects.

I've studied at the Radboud University, where I've obtained my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence and my two Master's Degrees in Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security. Currently, I'm doing a PhD at the Radboud University in the CESCA Lab within the Digital Security Group.

In my free time, I'd like to do sports, go for hikes, make music, solve puzzles and read books.
