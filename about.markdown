Welcome to my website! I'm an enthousiastic Artificial Intelligence & Cyber Security student. On this website, I try to explain concepts within this field in a comprehensive and intuitive way using daily examples. 

I've studied at the Radboud University, where I've obtained my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence. I am currently finalishing my two Master's Degrees in Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security.

In my free time, I'd like to do sports, go for hikes, make music, solve puzzles and read books.
