The field of <i>hardware security</i> refers to protecting the physical components of a computer. It assumes direct access to the hardware and this field includes anything ranging from managing <i>access control</i> to <i>hardware design</i>. Physical security on your hardware is important, as the hardware can be manipulated by an adversarial. This ranges from plugging a malicious USB into a device to reading information from a monitor screen. It can also be performed more technically by observing power consumption or manipulating input current to inject a fault into the hardware.
